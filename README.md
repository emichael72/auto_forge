# AutoForge

Welcome to **AutoForge**, the SDK companion Bob the Builder.

**AutoForge** is a flexible and extensible Python framework designed to streamline and enhance modern build workflows. It provides a powerful set of tools to define and manage complete build systems — from initial setup and environment preparation, through compilation and deployment, all the way to logging, error handling, and reporting.

At its core, AutoForge is driven by a set of simple, declarative JSON definitions, allowing teams to configure build behavior with minimal boilerplate.

Key features include:

- Modular, CLI-driven architecture
- Standardized logging and structured error reporting
- Automated environment setup and teardown
- JSON-based configuration for repeatable builds
- Dynamic command loading for easy extension

AutoForge was built with scalability in mind — whether you're managing a small embedded project or orchestrating complex multi-stage builds, it provides the right balance of automation, clarity, and control.
