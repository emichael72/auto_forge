Tool: make

Make is required to build projects using Makefiles, which define how source files are compiled and linked.
Your system must have GNU Make version 3.16 or higher.

Installation:

Fedora:
  sudo dnf install make

Ubuntu/Debian:
  sudo apt install make

macOS (with Homebrew):
  brew install make

If you're using WSL, ensure build tools are installed inside WSL, not just on Windows.
