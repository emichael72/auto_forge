# Ninja — Build System Guide

## 🔧 Description:

Ninja is a fast, low-level build system designed to execute build rules generated by higher-level tools like CMake. It
is not meant to be used directly for authoring build logic, but rather to **run builds efficiently and in parallel**.

---

## ⚙️ Basic Usage

```bash
ninja -C <build_dir>
```

- `-C <build_dir>` tells Ninja to operate inside the specified build directory (where `build.ninja` exists).
- This will build the default target, usually `all`.

---

## ⚡ Parallel Build

```bash
ninja -C <build_dir> -j <N>
```

- `-j <N>` controls the number of concurrent jobs (typically set to number of CPU cores).
- Omit `-j` to let Ninja auto-detect a reasonable level of parallelism.

---

## 🔍 Verbose Build Output

```bash
ninja -C <build_dir> -v
```

- `-v` prints all compiler/linker commands being executed.
- Helpful for debugging build failures or verifying flags.

---

## 🧹 Clean the Build

```bash
ninja -C <build_dir> -t clean
```

- Removes all build outputs, but **does not** delete the build.ninja file or CMake cache.

---

## 📋 List All Targets

```bash
ninja -C <build_dir> -t targets
```

- Lists all available build targets defined in the build.ninja file.

---

## 🧠 Tips

- Ninja builds are typically generated by tools like CMake:
  ```bash
  cmake -S . -B <build_dir> -G Ninja
  ```
- You rarely hand-write `build.ninja` files.
- Ninja is especially good for large or incremental builds where performance matters.

---

## ✅ Example

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
ninja -C build -j8 -v
```
