# Overlay - JSON Recipe Guide

## ðŸ“„ Description

This tool allows you to define a conversion table, where each entry consists of two fields: `'archive'` and
`'destination'`.
These fields indicate the path and name of a file within an archive (typically a ZIP file) and its corresponding path
and name in the regular file system.

### Example mapping:

    Archive path                        Destination path
    ---------------------               ----------------------------
    path/to/source/hello.c              new/repo/sources/new_hello.c

### What does it do?

The tool supports two main operations:

1. Deploying the contents of an archive to a destination directory based on the mapping.
2. Creating an archive from destination files, using the specified archive paths.

### When is this useful?

When you need to apply modifications to a set of source files without committing them to a Git repository.
This tool allows you to spread modified files across a target path, resulting in a patched version of the repository.
Later, as files are changed or new ones are added to the list, you can regenerate an archive thatâ€™s ready to be
deployed.

## ðŸ§¾ Recipe Format

The tool uses a JSON or JSONC file (called a "recipe") to describe the file mapping and behavioral defaults.
